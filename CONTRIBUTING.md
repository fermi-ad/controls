## Resources

### Code of conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to ensure that participation in our project and our community is considerate, patient, respectful, kind, inquisitive, and helpful.

[Read the full code of conduct.](https://github.com/fermi-ad/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Style guide

Controls is early in the process of defining a code style. To move forward without getting stuck answering questions of style, defer to the [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) as the authority unless more specific guidance is given.

## How to contribute

We want contributing to be fun and educational for everyone. If you’re interested in participating, contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. We are thrilled to receive various other contributions, whether you’re contributing code, docs, a talk, an article, or something else that helps.

### Help others

Answering questions from fellow users on Slack or GitHub Discussions is a valuable contribution. You can also help out users with issues and Pull Requests to contribute to or fix their issues.

### Contribute code

Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make. Controls code consists of many repos, and thus, it can be difficult to know where to start. Read the specific code contribution guidelines for a given repo to learn how to set up the repository locally, how to contribute to the ecosystem, and how to create a Pull Request.

### Help triage issues

Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the given reproduction, verifying the issue’s validity, and investigating the root cause of the issue. You don’t have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although it would certainly be much appreciated), but sharing the results of your investigation can save us a ton of time.

### Contribute to RFCs

Some changes are “substantial”, and we ask that these be put through a design process and produce a consensus among the Controls team. We use the request for comments process to vet these proposals. Taking the time to document these proposals thoughtfully is incredibly valuable, even if the proposal is not accepted. See the [RFC guidance](./RFC.md) for more details.
